# `ipscrub`

`ipscrub` is an IP address anonymizer for [nginx](https://www.nginx.com) log files. It's an nginx module that generates an IP-based hash. You can use this hash to link requests from the same source, without identifying your users by IP address.

## Security Model

1. On initialization, and again every `PERIOD`, generate `salt` using 128bits from `arc4random_buf()`.
2. On each request, generate masked IP address as `HASH(salt ++ IP address)`.
3. Log masked IP address.

`ipscrub` uses `arc4random` to generate random nonces (see [Theo de Raat's talk on arc4random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWmLWx8ut20) for a great overview). On Linux this requires installing [libbsd](https://libbsd.freedesktop.org/wiki/) (package libbsd-dev on Ubuntu/Debian). 

ALSO NOTE: the generated hash WILL change on each `PERIOD` transition, so you will only have continuity within each `PERIOD`. But because users can transition between networks at any time (e.g. wifi -> cellular), you'd have this type of issue even if you were storing raw IPs.

## Threat Model

1. Government presents you with an IP address and demands identification of user corresponding to that address.
2. Government identifies a user e.g. by email address, and demands IP address they had at some point in time.

In threat scenario (1), the goal is to compute the masked IP corresponding to a target IP address. This will only be possible if the demand is made before the end of the current `PERIOD`.

Scenario (2) is defended against because the server operator does not know the salt, and cannot infer it based on the request timestamp, because the salt is generated from a nonce that is only stored in memory. The server operator would have to be an accomplice in this case, but that is more simply accomplished by the server operator just recording the unmasked IP. So this security/threat model does not defend against a malicious server operator, but that is not the point. It does defend against an honest server operator being compelled in threat scenarios (1) and (2).

## Usage

### Installation

#### Building From Source

`ipscrub` can be built statically with nginx or as a [dynamic module](https://www.nginx.com/blog/compiling-dynamic-modules-nginx-plus/). See the `Makefile` for examples of both ways.

#### Configuration

In your `nginx.conf`,

1. At the top-level, load the module by adding the line `load_module ngx_ipscrub_module.so;` (NOTE: only if you built as a dynamic module).
1. Set `ipscrub_period_seconds <NUM SECONDS PER PERIOD>;` (optional).
1. In your `log_format` directives, replace `$remote_addr` with `$remote_addr_ipscrub`.
1. Reload your nginx config.

**NOTE**: nginx may still leak IP addresses in the error log. If this is a concern, disable error logging or wipe the log regularly.

#### Running Tests

`make test`

#### Checking for Updates

`make check-up-to-date`

This will have a non-zero exit code if you aren't up-to-date, so you can automate regular checks.

### Changelog

- 1.0.1 fixed vulnerability to unmasking hashed IPs (thanks to [@marcan](https://github.com/marcan))
- 1.0.0 initial release

## GDPR

[GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org) goes into effect on May 25, 2018. It legislates the handling of personal data about your users, including IP addresses.

From https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.html:

    What constitutes personal data?

    Any information related to a natural person or ‘Data Subject’, that can be used to directly or indirectly identify the person. It can be anything from a name, a photo, [...], or a computer IP address.

The hashes generated by `ipscrub` let you correlate nginx log entries by IP address, without actually storing IP addresses, reducing your GDPR surface area.

## YAGNI

Why are you logging IP addresses anyway? [You Ain't Gonna Need It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it). If you want geolocation, just use [MaxMind's GeoIP module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_geoip_module.html) in conjunction with `ipscrub`.
